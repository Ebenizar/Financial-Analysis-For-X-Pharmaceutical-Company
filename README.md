### Data Analysis: 

Arithmetic summation was carried out for all columns containing number values. This was done for each month 

A summary table was create for the data set of each month, containing the profit and revenue generated

The summary table for the three months were merged together as seen above, and using pivot table, the above dashboard was also created

### Result, Findings and COnclusions

From the dashboard we can see a steep decline in revenue and profit made from the the month of May to the month of June and then we can see a slight increase in the month of July. This all happens because there was a decline in sales or purchases made by customers. 

In the Month of may precisely 29th in Nigeria, a new government came into power, and this government placed a new policy of fuel subsidy removal. This fuel subsidy removal increased the prices of virtually all products in the market and customers were affected by this change, which resulted in the following

- Customers were forced to cut down on expenses, and also cut down movement to stores where they could get products they need due to increased  transportation cost 

- Customers were also forced to get cheaper products as substitute to the original and costly ones bought previously

- Special customers who buy from that particular store despite distance from their residence, were force to buy products from nearby stores 

- In general terms, walk in customers and purchasing power reduced

- Meanwhile in the Month of July we can see that the customers Revenue is slightly increasing. We can say its for the following reasons

- Customers are adjusting to the new change, and prioritizing expenditure

- Some companies place a new policy allowing staffs to come to work for only three times a week as opposed to coming to work five (5) times a week, this now allows them to save more from transportation and spend more on health and feeding

- In Summary : There was a sharp decline in sales and revenue between the month of May and June but an increase occurred between June and July .The sharp decline in sales was as a result of economic factors, financial policies adopted by the government and we begin to see increment in sales and revenue within a period of 30 days

### Recommendations

1. Adopt a Telemedicine and digital marketing strategy to increase reach to more clients to help client make purchases from their homes

2. Offer home delivery services to clients at a subsidized rate

3. Provide alternative cheaper brands of products with similar quality to help improve patronage
